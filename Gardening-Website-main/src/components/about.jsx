The Garden Up Store started as a small offshoot of Garden Up and
 found immense success in early trials. Our niche of ecofriendly 
 gardening supplies, accessories, and products has helped us reach where we are today.
<br/><br/>
While Ekta, our founder, was developing Garden Up, she came across a 
gaping hole in the commercial gardening market. There was no one place 
where an environmentally conscious gardener could go looking for supplies and inspiration. There had to be at least one store where she didn’t need to worry about where products were manufactured, what materials they were made with, false advertising, a limited catalog and all the other troubles an urban gardener faces every day. But there was no such place.
<br/><br/>
Taking matters into her own hands, Ekta trialed a little store where someone
 like her could go shopping for all her gardening needs. In the span of a few
  months, this little experiment soared. Thus was born the Garden Up Store.
  <br/><br/>
Since 2019, Ekta has been using her vast and highly curated network of artisans and gardening supplies manufacturers to keep the Store well-stocked, updated, and always improving.<br/><br/>
The Garden Up Store also supports Indian brands with excellent products but is in need of wide exposure. In the process, we cross paths with many highly skilled and ambitious artisans and small business owners across the country. 
We are proud to say that we mentor artisans, vendors, and handicraft communities. Many of our vendors are women from across the country whom we mentored, trained, and supported with the practical knowledge necessary for commercial success.
<br/><br/>
The Store is now proudly run by a small team led by a former vendor with the same values and high standards. With our experience and ethical goals, we do our best to protect our vendors’ interests and deliver on our promises to our invaluable patrons. </h2>
